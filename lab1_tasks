Things to be done:
1) 5 sentences for all teams (I think we should from one of the databases)

[We will create a folder named 'lab1_practise_sentecenes' with above 5 wav files, it will be useful to upload in moodle easily]

2) Testing Phase

We need to select the 10 more senteces and prepare the following things for each of them

(i) Eneregy (STE)
(ii) ZCR 
(iii) Low-frequency 

I will look for matlab code for STE and ZCR. 
Can you see how to do Low freq.
